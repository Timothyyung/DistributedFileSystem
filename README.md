Git commit part 2 is in the SECOND BRANCH: ____ description:

These two branches experiments with different methods of data storage and retrieval

MASTER branch has storage and retrieval done in the storage node ( hashing is done in the storage node )
The second branch has storage and retrieval done in the client ( hashing is done in the client node )

Other than where the hashing is done both branches function mostly the same.

- will consider the client side hashing as the main branch for now
- replication is done two times after storage

What is left to do _____ heartbeats and UI and loading into orion

Need port assignment...
